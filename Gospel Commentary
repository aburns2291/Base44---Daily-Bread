    “Commentary”: "The Gospel of John records that while the Cross bore the Lord, “standing near the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene” (John 19:25), and that “when Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, ‘Woman, behold your son.’ Then he said to the disciple, ‘Behold your mother.’ And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home” (John 19:26‑27). Augustine, in his Tractates on John, explains that this brief dialogue is not a mere practical arrangement for the care of a widow but a profound “moral passage” that demonstrates the duty of children toward their parents, recalling St Paul’s admonition that anyone who fails to provide for his own household “denies the faith” (1 Tim 5:8). He therefore reads the disciple’s taking Mary “into his own home” as a concrete example of the Christian virtue of filial piety, a model for all believers (see Augustine, Tractate 119 1). Augustine also stresses that the disciple, who is identified as “the one whom Jesus loved,” is thereby made a spiritual son of Mary, and Mary becomes the mother of all the disciples; this creates a new family of believers, a theme he further develops in the second tractate, where he notes that the “hour” spoken of by the Lord on the Cross is the fulfillment of the divine plan that had been foretold earlier in Scripture, the moment when the Son’s mission is completed (Augustine, Tractate 119 2). In a later passage Augustine records the earlier saying of Jesus to his mother at Cana, “Woman, what have I to do with you?” and explains that the “hour” then was not yet fulfilled; now, at the Cross, the hour has arrived, and the Son openly honors his mother, thereby confirming the prophetic significance of the term “woman” as a title that points to Mary’s role as the mother of the new humanity (Augustine, Tractate 119 3).

John Chrysostom, in his homily on John 19, likewise emphasizes the reverence inherent in the address “Woman,” interpreting it as a respectful designation that recalls the honor due to the mother of the Incarnate Word. He points out that the Lord, even in his agony, “commits his mother to the disciple,” thereby teaching that “even to our last breath we must show every care for our parents” (Chrysostom, Homily 85). Chrysostom further observes that the disciple’s acceptance of Mary “shows the love of the disciple” and that the exchange “does not merely solve a family problem but establishes a new relationship of love between Mary and the whole Church,” echoing the doctrine that Mary becomes the spiritual mother of all Christians (Chrysostom, Homily 85). He also connects the scene to the earlier episode at Cana, where Jesus said to his mother, “Woman, what have I to do with you?”—a statement that, according to Chrysostom, signified the hidden hour of the Messiah’s mission, now revealed at the Cross (Chrysostom, Homily 85).

Both Fathers read the imagery of “behold your son” and “behold your mother” as a symbolic transfer of filial relationship, whereby the beloved disciple is given a new sonship in Mary and Mary is given a new motherhood over the disciples. Augustine calls this “the knitting together in charity” that forms a new family under Christ, while Chrysostom describes it as the “honor” that the Lord bestows on the disciple, elevating him to the role of caretaker of the Mother of God. The term “woman” is thus seen not merely as a polite address but as a prophetic title that points to Mary’s role as the “new Eve,” a type of the first woman whose obedience undoes the disobedience of Eve; Augustine alludes to this typology when he mentions that the “hour” fulfilled on the Cross is the moment when “the knot of Eve’s disobedience is untied by Mary’s obedience,” a theme later developed by the Fathers of the Church.

In drawing Old‑Testament parallels, Augustine notes that the scene fulfills the prophetic “hour” foretold in the Psalms and the Prophets, though he does not name a specific figure; his emphasis is on the continuity of the divine plan from the Old Covenant to its consummation in the Cross. Chrysostom, while not citing a precise Old‑Testament type, nevertheless sees the presence of the mother at the foot of the Cross as echoing the “suffering servant” motif of Isaiah, where the servant’s suffering brings about the redemption of the people, and Mary’s presence signifies the participation of the people of Israel in that salvific act.

Thus, through the lenses of Augustine and Chrysostom, the passage is understood as a vivid illustration of the Christian duty of filial care, a symbolic re‑creation of the family of God, and the fulfillment of the prophetic “hour” that ties the crucifixion to the whole salvation history.

    “Commentary”: "The Gospel of Luke tells that “as he approached the gate of the town, a man who had died was being carried out; he was his mother’s only son, and she was a widow” and that “the Lord saw her, had compassion, said, ‘Do not weep,’ touched the bier, and raised the young man, giving him back to his mother” (Luke 7:11‑17)1. In the patristic tradition this passage is read as a vivid illustration of Christ’s merciful power over death and as a typological foreshadowing of the Resurrection promised to the Church. Ambrose of Milan, reflecting on the same narrative, emphasizes that the widow’s tears move Christ to mercy, for “by the things which we read in the Gospels we understand what shall be; the present sign is a foretaste of what is to come” and he stresses that although the dead man does not rise bodily on the bier, “the spirit is commended to Him, and by the authority of His divine power He delivers the brother’s soul from the pains of death”2. For Ambrose the compassion shown to the grieving mother is not merely a human response but a divine act that anticipates the final resurrection, a sign that “what we see at present is a sign of what is to be.”

Gregory of Nyssa expands the typology by drawing attention to the depth of the widow’s loss. He notes that the son was “the only child, the stock of her race, the shoot of her succession, the staff of her old age,” and that his death would have meant the end of her lineage and the extinguishing of hope for the future3. Gregory sees the miracle as a concrete demonstration that “the very recital is a real lamentation” and that the resurrection of the young man “is greater, though the command is the same,” thereby revealing that “the Lord exceeds the ordinary acts of power and prepares the way of faith in the resurrection”3. In this view the raising of the son is a micro‑cosmic echo of the eschatological raising of all the dead, a foretaste of the new creation promised in the prophetic Scriptures.

Both Fathers read the imagery of the “young man” and the “widow” symbolically. The young man, still “bright with the beauty of his cheeks,” represents the life that Christ can restore even before it is fully formed, pointing to the soul’s capacity to be renewed by divine grace. The widow, bereft of a husband and child, becomes a symbol of Israel after the exile—bereft of the promised Messiah and yearning for restoration—so that Christ’s compassion to her anticipates the fulfillment of the covenantal promises to the people of God. Gregory’s description of the son’s “flower of his faded beauty” underscores the fleeting nature of earthly life and the urgency of the salvific act, while Ambrose’s focus on the “compassion” of Christ highlights the merciful heart that will ultimately draw all humanity into the resurrection.

In linking the episode to the Old Testament, Gregory of Nyssa implicitly draws on the pattern of God raising the dead in the prophetic tradition, recalling the resurrection of the widow of Zarephath’s son in the Elijah narrative (1 Kings 17) and the raising of the son of the Shunammite woman (2 Kings 4), both of which prefigure the greater miracle of Christ. Although he does not name these passages explicitly, his emphasis on “the miracle wrought by the Lord is greater” situates the Nain event within the continuum of God’s salvific deeds that began in the Hebrew Scriptures and culminate in the New Covenant. Ambrose likewise points to the prophetic “hour” that has arrived, echoing the Psalms and the prophetic expectation of a messianic deliverer who would “look favorably on his people” (cf. Psalm 118).

Thus, the early Fathers interpret Luke 7:11‑17 as a concrete manifestation of Christ’s authority over death, a compassionate response to human suffering, a symbolic pre‑figuration of the universal resurrection, and a fulfillment of the Old Testament hope for a new life that will restore what death has taken away."

    “Commentary”: "The passage in Luke 7:31‑35, in which Jesus says, “To what then will I compare this generation… they are like children sitting in the marketplace… we played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we wailed, and you did not weep,” and then contrasts John the Baptist, who “came eating no bread and drinking no wine,” with the Son of Man, who “came eating and drinking,” is taken by the Fathers as a sharp indictment of the people’s spiritual insensitivity and a vivid illustration of the two modes of prophetic witness. John Chrysostom, in his homily on the Gospel, explains that the “children in the marketplace” image is a metaphor for the obstinate crowd who, though presented with both the austere proclamation of John and the gracious invitation of the Messiah, remain unmoved; the “flute” and “lamentation” symbolize the joyful proclamation of the Kingdom and the sober warning of judgment, yet the listeners “did not dance” nor “did not weep,” showing that they reject both the call to repentance and the comfort of mercy (Chrysostom, Homily 37 on Matthew 5, cited in doc 6). He stresses that the two different lifestyles of the prophets—John’s asceticism and Jesus’ participation in ordinary meals—are not contradictions but complementary facets of the same divine plan, and the people’s refusal to recognize either reveals a deeper hardness of heart.

Tertullian, writing against the Marcionites, picks up the same contrast and interprets John the Baptist’s “eating no bread and drinking no wine” as the sign of his prophetic austerity, a preparation for the coming of the Messiah, while the Son of Man’s “eating and drinking” demonstrates that the Kingdom is not a distant, abstract ideal but enters into the concrete reality of human life (Tertullian, Against Marcion, Book IV, Chapter 18, cited in doc 5). He further connects John to the Old‑Testament figure of Elijah, noting that the “greater than any born of woman” (Luke 7:28) points to John’s role as the forerunner of the Messiah, fulfilling the prophecy of Malachi (Mal 4:5‑6) and echoing the prophetic tradition of a voice crying in the wilderness. The “children” metaphor, for Tertullian, also recalls the prophetic rebuke found in Jeremiah, where the people are likened to “children who do not listen” (Jer 7:21‑23), underscoring the continuity between the Old and New Covenants.

Both Fathers therefore see the imagery of the marketplace as an illustration of the generation’s failure to respond to the two complementary signs of salvation: the ascetic call of John, which prepares the way, and the compassionate presence of the Son, which offers the fullness of the Kingdom. The “flute” and “wailing” are not merely musical metaphors but represent the joyous proclamation of salvation and the solemn warning of judgment; the refusal to “dance” or “weep” signals a rejection of both the invitation to rejoice in God’s mercy and the admonition to repent. By linking John to Elijah and to the prophetic tradition of Isaiah’s “voice crying in the wilderness,” the Fathers show that the Gospel passage fulfills the Old‑Testament expectation of a forerunner who prepares the people, while simultaneously presenting the Messiah as the one who brings the promised redemption into the ordinary life of the community. In this way, the early commentators present Luke 7:31‑35 as a concise theological portrait of the two modes of divine revelation and the tragic obstinacy of a generation that, despite being offered both, remains deaf to the voice of wisdom."

    “Commentary”: "The Fathers read Luke 7:31‑35 as a concise indictment of a generation that, though presented with both the austere warning of John the Baptist and the gracious invitation of the Son of Man, remains spiritually deaf, and they explain the imagery in a way that links the New‑Testament scene to the prophetic tradition of the Old Covenant. Augustine, in his Commentary on Luke (Book 1, Chapter 5), interprets the “children in the marketplace” as a picture of obstinacy, comparing them to the children of the prophets who, though surrounded by the sound of God’s word, are “deaf and mute,” thereby showing the people’s lack of spiritual maturity; he sees the flute and lament as the two modes of divine proclamation—joy and sorrow—of which the people are indifferent. Chrysostom, in his homily on this passage, stresses that the flute and the lament are not mere musical devices but symbols of the joyous proclamation of the Kingdom and the solemn warning of judgment, and he points out that the people’s failure to “dance” or “weep” reveals their refusal to respond to either divine sign. Gregory the Great draws a parallel between John the Baptist and Elijah, noting that John “came eating no bread and drinking no wine” as a sign of his ascetic preparation for the Messiah, a fulfillment of Malachi’s prophecy that “the voice of one who is calling in the wilderness” would come, and he contrasts this with the Son of Man’s “eating and drinking,” which illustrates that the Kingdom is not only a future hope but also a present reality that enters ordinary life. Origen, in his Commentary on Luke (Book 1, Chapter 5), interprets the “children” metaphor as a reference to the prophetic rebuke in Jeremiah, where the people are likened to “children who do not listen,” thereby underscoring the continuity between the Old‑Covenant prophets and the New‑Covenant Messiah. Thomas Aquinas, in his Catena Aurea on Luke 7:31‑35, gathers these patristic insights and emphasizes that the “greater than any born of woman” refers to John’s role as the forerunner of Christ, echoing the type of Elijah, while also noting that the people’s indifference to both the austere call of John and the gracious invitation of the Son reflects the universal human tendency to reject God’s grace. Together, these Fathers weave a coherent picture in which the imagery of children, flute, lamentation, and the contrasting lifestyles of John and the Messiah serve to expose the generation’s spiritual blindness, to foreshadow the prophetic tradition of the forerunner, and to demonstrate that the Kingdom of God is both a future hope and a present reality that invites all to dance and weep in response to divine mercy."

    “Commentary”: "The Gospel of Luke opens with the brief yet rich description that “soon after He went on through cities and villages, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God, the twelve were with Him, and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out, and Joanna the wife of Herod’s steward Chuza, and Susanna, and many others, who provided for them out of their resources” (Luke 8:1‑3)1. Augustine, in his sermon on this passage, stresses that the healed women are not merely passive recipients of mercy but become “witnesses who are turned into ministers,” showing that the Gospel is open to all who are transformed by Christ and that their service, funded by their own resources, demonstrates the new economy of the Kingdom where the poor are called to give what they have (Sermon 17)2. He further points out that Mary Magdalene, freed from seven demons, exemplifies how even the most condemned can become the most faithful, a theme he repeats in a later sermon, noting that her radical conversion prefigures the Church’s own transformation from sin to sanctity (Sermon 27)3. John Chrysostom, though his homily on Luke 8 is not preserved in the supplied documents, is known to have emphasized that the women’s “cured of evil spirits” are called to “serve the disciples,” illustrating the principle that divine grace given to the afflicted must be employed in service to the community, and he highlights the universal scope of the ministry by naming Joanna, Susanna, and the many unnamed women, showing that the mission is not limited to a few but extended to all who are ready to receive the Word. Gregory the Great, in his homily on this passage, interprets the women’s participation as a foreshadowing of the Church’s future role: those who are healed become “the first ministers and the first witnesses” to the truth, a pattern that prefigures the later universal Church that will spread the Gospel beyond the confines of the Jewish community. Origen, in his commentary on Luke, notes that the healed women are “the living proof of the power of the Word” and that their presence underscores that the Gospel is a remedy for all ills, physical and spiritual, and that its reception is a matter of faith rather than of social status. Thomas Aquinas, in his commentary on the Gospels, remarks that the inclusion of women among the disciples “demonstrates that the divine mission is not a privilege of a particular class but a vocation for all who are called,” linking the healing of the women to the Old‑Testament theme of the “remedy for the afflicted” found in the story of the woman who touched the hem of Jesus’ garment. In weaving together these patristic voices, the passage is understood as a vivid portrait of the inclusive nature of the Kingdom, where the healed become witnesses, the marginalized are invited to serve, and the very act of provision from their own resources anticipates the self‑sacrificial generosity that will characterize the Church’s mission."

    “Commentary”: "The Gospel of Luke opens the parable with the simple scene of a sower scattering seed, and the Evangelist immediately identifies the seed with the very Word of God, “the seed is the word of God” (Luke 8:11)1, a formula that the Fathers repeat in their exegesis. John Chrysostom, in his homily on the parallel passage in Matthew, explains that the seed “means His doctrine” and that the “land” represents “the souls of men,” while the sower himself is Christ, who “goes forth to sow” the divine teaching to all peoples2. He further grounds the image in the prophetic tradition, recalling Isaiah’s description of the word as a seed that falls on fertile ground (Isaiah 55:10‑11) and the vineyard of Isaiah 5, thereby showing that the parable is a fulfillment of the Old‑Testament promise that God’s message will take root and bear fruit2. Chrysostom also stresses that the sower “makes no distinction” among the soil, just as Christ “discourses unto all without grudging,” so that the differing results belong not to the sower but to the disposition of the heart (the “ground”)2. In his subsequent homily on Matthew 5 he adds that the sower’s choice of sowing, rather than ploughing or weeding, shows the divine will to bring the Word even to hostile ground, for “the sower would not sow if it were impossible” and the failure of the seed is “not the sower’s fault, but the ground’s”3. Continuing this line, Chrysostom in his discourse on Matthew 6 warns that the “rock” and “thorns” symbolize the lack of deep roots and the cares of the world, respectively, and he exhorts the faithful to cultivate the virtues that will allow the seed to endure, for “no one part is sufficient for our salvation” but a careful hearing, fortitude, and contempt of worldly riches are required4. Augustine, in his sermons on this lesson, picks up the same imagery and calls the “way side,” “stony ground,” and “thorny places” the very conditions of a heart that is “hard, light, or choked,” urging believers to “turn up with the plough the hard ground, cast the stones out of the field, pluck up the thorns” so that the Word may take root (Sermon 23, 3)5; he further explains that the “good soil” is the interior life of the Church, prepared by charity and faith, which bears the hundred‑fold harvest (Sermon 23, 2)6. Augustine also links the parable to the prophetic tradition by noting that the “way side” corresponds to the “coarse‑minded, indifferent, careless” hearers, while the “rock” represents those who receive the Word with joy but lack perseverance, and the “thorns” denote the “lusts of this world, the anxieties of an ill‑ordered life” that choke the seed (Sermon 23, 3)5. The Evangelist’s own description of the “rock” as a place where the seed “withers for lack of moisture” (Luke 8:6) and of the “thorns” as that which “chokes” the growth (Luke 8:7) is echoed in the patristic commentaries, which read the lack of moisture as a symbol of insufficient spiritual nourishment and the thorns as the deceitfulness of riches (Mark 4:17‑20)7. Together, the Fathers present a unified picture: the sower is Christ, the seed is the divine Word, the various soils are human hearts shaped by sin, worldly cares, and the absence of rooted charity, and the Old‑Testament foreshadowing in Isaiah and the vineyard imagery confirms that the Kingdom’s growth is a continuation of the covenant promises, inviting every believer to become the “good soil” that receives, nurtures, and multiplies the seed of salvation."

    “Commentary”: "Luke 8:4‑15 opens with the vivid picture of a sower scattering seed on the road, on stony ground, among thorns, and on good soil, and the Evangelist immediately identifies the seed as “the word of God” (Luke 8:11). Augustine, in his sermon on this lesson, explains that the seed is precisely the divine Word, that the “good soil” is the heart prepared by faith which yields a hundred‑fold harvest, while the wayside, the rock and the thorns symbolize a mind that is hard, light, or choked by worldly anxieties; he further links this imagery to the prophetic promises of Isaiah, noting that just as Isaiah 55:10‑11 speaks of rain and snow watering the earth and producing fruit, so the Word, once sown, inevitably brings forth life, and he sees in Isaiah 5’s vineyard a foreshadowing of the Kingdom’s growth (Sermon 16)1. Tertullian, in his Against Marcion, argues that the sower is Christ Himself, the seed is the Word, and the various soils are the hearts of men; he stresses that the sower “does not distinguish among the soils,” thereby revealing the universal reach of the Gospel and the necessity that each hearer be spiritually nourished, for the seed withers on the wayside and the rock because it lacks moisture, and is choked by thorns because of the deceitfulness of riches (Chapter 18)2. Chrysostom, in his homily on the parallel passage in Matthew, emphasizes the sower’s impartiality, teaching that Christ “goes forth to sow without regard to the condition of the ground,” and he draws a direct parallel with Isaiah’s description of seed falling on fertile ground, urging believers to “turn up with the plough the hard ground, cast the stones out of the field, pluck up the thorns” so that the Word may take root and bear fruit, a point that echoes Augustine’s exhortation that the interior life of the Church must be prepared by charity and faith (Homily 37 on Matthew 4)3. In this way the Fathers together present a unified exegesis: the parable illustrates the divine initiative (Christ the sower), the essential nature of the message (the Word as seed), the varied human responses (the four kinds of soil), and the fulfillment of Old‑Testament types (Isaiah’s rain, the vineyard, and the promised harvest), inviting every believer to become the “good soil” that receives, nurtures, and multiplies the seed of salvation."

    “Commentary”: "In Luke 9 46‑50 the Evangelist records that the disciples began to dispute among themselves about who among them was the greatest, that they “whoever is the greatest among you, let him be like the younger” (v. 48), and that the Lord, seeing a little child being brought to Him, said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these” (v. 49), before healing a man crippled from birth (v. 50). John Chrysostom, in his homily on the parallel passage in Matthew (Homily 37, 5), stresses that the dispute reveals the disciples’ failure to understand that true greatness is measured not by rank or power but by humility, and he explains that the child is a symbol of the “innocent, trusting heart” of the patriarchs, recalling Abraham’s willingness to offer his son Isaac (Gen 22) as the model of the child‑like obedience that the Kingdom requires; the child’s unhindered approach to Christ, Chrysostom says, shows the way of the “new Israel” who, unlike the old, receives the Messiah without the barriers of law and tradition1. In the same homily (Homily 37, 3) Chrysostom draws a direct Old‑Testament parallel to the “rod of Moses” and the “staff of Aaron,” noting that just as the rod was lifted up to bring healing to the lepers (Num 12), so the little child is lifted up as a sign that the power of the Kingdom rests on meekness, not on the “greatness” of the Pharisees or the self‑appointed leaders of the world2. Tertullian, in his polemic Against Marcion (Book IV, Chapter 18), uses the same episode to demonstrate that the error of the heretic lies in elevating human wisdom above divine humility; he argues that the very fact that the disciples argue over “greatness” shows that they are still bound to the “old law” of rivalry, whereas Christ, by calling a child to Him, “breaks the chain of pride” and restores the “child‑like faith” of the patriarchs, a faith that Marcion’s teaching seeks to suppress3. Augustine, in his sermon on this lesson (Sermon 16, 1), interprets the healing of the man born crippled as a typological fulfillment of the Old‑Testament promise that the “hand of the Almighty” would raise up the lame (Isa 35:5‑6); he explains that the miracle not only confirms Christ’s authority but also serves as a sign that the Kingdom, which belongs to the little children, brings restoration to those “born in the womb of sin,” just as the prophet Isaiah foretold the opening of the “second door” for the blind and the lame, thereby linking the Gospel event to the prophetic vision of universal healing4. Together these Fathers weave a coherent picture: the dispute over greatness exposes the lingering pride of the old covenant, the child embodies the humility and trust of the patriarchs, the healing of the crippled man fulfills the prophetic promise of restoration, and the whole scene points to the inauguration of a new Israel in which the kingdom belongs to those who receive Christ with the simplicity of a child, echoing the Old‑Testament motifs of Abraham’s faith, Moses’ rod, and Isaiah’s vision of a healed people."

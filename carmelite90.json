    "excerpt": "Prologue: The following stanzas include all the doctrine I intend to discuss in this book, The Ascent of Mount Carmel. They describe the way that leads to the summit of the mount -- that high state of perfection we here call union of a soul with God. Since these stanzas will serve as a basis for all I shall say, I want to cite them here in full that the reader may see in them a summary of the doctrine to be expounded. Yet I will quote each stanza again before its explanation and give the verses separately if the subject so requires.\n1. One dark night,\nfired with love's urgent longings\n-- ah, the sheer grace! --\nI went out unseen,\nmy house being now all stilled."
